# Talking Villagers
## Description
Villagers are talking different voice lines, like greetings, small-talk and similar.
The mod lets you easily add different voices with resource packs. Every villager gets a random voice from the installed voices.

## Install voices
### Step 1: Client
Add resource pack for the voice into the "resourcepack"-folder in .minecraft.
### Step 2: Client or Server
Add [voicename].json file into ../talkingvillagers/voices/ in the config folder of your server or client, if you want to play SinglePlayer.
## Add your own voice lines
